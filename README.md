# Steps

## Creating a new working area for the CTF

### Creating a new branch (Or a FORK)
Usually, providing write-ups during the time of the CTF is **forbidden**, so you might want to **fork this repository** and put it in **private** to publish your write-ups
* If there's only one Fx0 team, use the github organisation private repo
* If you're alone or there's multiple Fx0 teams [fork this repo](https://github.com/flagexcepti0n/write-ups/fork)

### Add the people you're working with as collaborators
* If your team is composed at 100% of Fx0 members, you don't need to worry, everyobdy already got access to the private repo
* If there are some people on your team that aren't Fx0 members, add them to the repo as external colaborators
* If you're working on a private repo because there are multiple FX0 teams, please add the people on your team to your repo
* If you're alone, please do not add anybody playing on the same CTF as you are

## Add your Write-ups

### Create a new Folder named after the ctf
* Copy and paste the official name of the CTF so the name perfectly match
* Try matching the naming conventions of the other folders present on the repo
* Make sure it is as much humanly readable as possible (you might want to tweak how it is formated if not)

### Create new Files for the challenges
* Please name the files so that they match the name of the challenge.
* Try matching the naming conventions of the other folders present on the repo
* Make sure it is as much humanly readable as possible (you might want to tweak how it is formated if not)
* All files should end with the extention `.md` (Markdown)
* They should also be placed into the folder of the CTF they belong to
